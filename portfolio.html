<h2>ABOUT MY WORK</h2>
   
<p class="portext">
    Welcome to my portfolio page! This page will feature some of the videos I have edited and produced over the last few years. You never know when a moment will become a memory, and I hope to be able to convey that philosophy through my works. Condensing all these pictures and videos into one single video puts into perspective just how fast life moves. It makes me cherish life and all the "litte things" a little more. I love video editing, and I love sharing my videos with my friends even more. My newest videos are at the top while my oldest ones are at the bottom. </p>


<h3>AUG 28 BOSTON OUTING</h3>

  This is a highlight of the Boston outing with Janice on August 28, 2022. Rather than using the black bars for this video (unlike all the other ones I've done pretty much thus far), I kept it full-screened. I guess it just looks better that way, since it's less cinematic (omg I didn't even intend to use this, it just slipped out). In this highlight, there's about 700+ pictures out of the 800~ pictures from that day. More about the outing in my blog :)</p>
  
   
<h3>2022 NAMI WALK HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

  Jules and I went back to NAMI Walk to volunteer again. Compared to when we did it for IWH, it's so much more laid-back, probably because we actually know what we were going to do before going. We had an itinerary and signed up for a less "physically demanding" job, so that helped, too. It was a nostalgia trip with wholesome moments. Also met the group commander of 1997; super cool.</p>

   
<h3>BUCCI GANG ICE CREAM EXPERIMENT</h3>

<p class="portext">
  This is a short highlight of an ice-cream-making experiment my lab group and I did for our chemistry class this year, featuring Nelson, Huan, and Katherine. This one is not as well-produced as my other projects but it’s for the sake of preserving memory, so it works for me. Lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop....</p>

     
<h3>SECRET VAULT CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 2021</h3>  

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woIMrNNsioo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

<p class="portext">There is SO much happening here. It's so cute though, in my opinion. There's a lot of intimacy and skinship in this video that makes it awkward but also one hell of a memory. SV, let's do it again this year.</p>
   
  
<h3>SECRET VAULT REWIND 2019-2021</h3>  

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxE5N68T32c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>   

<p class="portext">Quarantine distanced us physically, but I managed to make some of my favorite people during it. Secret Vault was created during quarantine, and a little before its 1st anniversary, I got the idea to do something special for it. Of course, it didn't happen because I didn't have enough footage nor enough time. I ended up pushing it for the end of 2021 and make it into a rewind of some sort. Every time I watch this (quite often actually), I have the biggest smile on my face. Thank you for being a part of my life SV.</p>

   
<h3>FRANKLIN AND NELSON'S WEDDING</h3>  

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-U1WjsO2k4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

<p class="portext">This was a fun little request from Jamie. Back then, I knew neither Franklin nor Nelson. Time flies. I had lots of fun making this, but it was also a huge headache. I've never done tracking before, so this was something totally new for me to learn. There's a little glitch in there that I cannot be bothered to fix it. Maybe one day I will get rid of it, but that day is not today.</p>

   
<h3>I WAS HERE FINAL PROJECT</h3>

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_XjoiVGBfY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   
<p class="portext">This is the final project video. We decided to tackle the subject of self-esteem. It's a community issues, state issue, national issue, and international issue. There's much to be done, but everything starts somewhere. No matter how small of a difference it may seem, we set out to make changes one step at a time. Some of the major things my groupmates and I accomplished for this project are showcased in here :)</p>

   
<h3>I WAS HERE TRAILER</h3>

<p class="portext">
  This is the trailer for a final product of a long-term project we had in 7th grade. The project is to find an issue in the community or world that you want to tackle. The objective is to help make a difference in the world. Here is the sneak peak of the final video, which includes one of the things we did that was related to our project. </p>

<p id="portextbottom">
  This is the first video-editing project I have ever attempted (probably). This was for an end-of-the-year 6th-grade project in tech class. We were tasked with creating a prototype of something, be it a physical object or an app. Then, we had to create our final product and make some kind of commercial for it. Starring Laura :) </p>
