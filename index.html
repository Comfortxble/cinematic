<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      
<p>
  Hi :) If you are here, chances are you know me, so I don't think I will need to disclose who I am. I made this as a documentation of my video editing projects. I wanted a nice platform to showcase some of my favorite works. I put a lot of effort into my edits. It takes blood, sweat, and tears, but at the end of the day, it's worth it after seeing the end results. This is mainly for Secret Vault, and I hope it makes you feel the same joy and happiness I feel when I spend time with you all.
</p>

<p id="hometextbottom">
Head to my portfolio page for the videos I decided to showcase and my blog page for my weblog. It's currently under construction. Although I no longer have no idea what to do with it, it will forever be updating (whenever I feel like it). I'm beginning to think that it's like the daily journal channel on my own Discord server.</p>
